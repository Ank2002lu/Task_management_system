Task Management System
The Task Management System is a powerful web application designed to facilitate the efficient management and assignment of tasks within projects to employees. Developed with HTML, CSS, Flask, and MySQL, this system provides a comprehensive solution for companies to streamline their project management processes.

Features
User Authentication: The system offers separate login interfaces for administrators and employees. Administrators (managers) can access advanced controls, while employees are granted limited access for task updates.

Project Management: Administrators can create, edit, and delete projects. Each project can include multiple tasks that require completion.

Task Assignment: Managers can assign specific tasks to individual employees, ensuring clear responsibilities within the team.

Task Status Tracking: Employees have the ability to update task statuses as they progress (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed). This enables real-time monitoring of project advancement.

User Roles and Permissions: Administrators have comprehensive control over projects, tasks, and assignments, while employees have a simplified interface for updating task statuses.

Notifications: Automated email notifications are sent out for task assignments and impending deadlines, helping teams stay informed.

Search and Filters: A user-friendly search and filter functionality enables easy location of projects, tasks, and employees.

Responsive Design: The system is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring smooth access across various devices and screen sizes.
